- [ ] Binary works: `envg init`, `envg set`, `envg list`
- [ ] Clean up: `npm uninstall -g @envguard/cli`

## âœ… Pre-Publish Validation

```bash
cd packages/cli

# Run all checks
pnpm typecheck && pnpm build && pnpm pack:check

# Verify package contents
npm pack --dry-run

# Should show:
# - LICENSE
# - README.md
# - dist/cli.js
# - dist/cli.d.ts
# - dist/index.js
# - dist/index.d.ts
# - dist/*.js.map
# - package.json
```

## âœ… Version Bump

Choose the appropriate version bump:

- **Patch** (0.1.0 â†’ 0.1.1): Bug fixes only
- **Minor** (0.1.0 â†’ 0.2.0): New features, backward compatible
- **Major** (0.1.0 â†’ 1.0.0): Breaking changes

```bash
npm version patch|minor|major
```

Or manually edit `package.json`

## ðŸš€ Ready to Publish!

If all items are checked, you're ready to publish:

```bash
cd packages/cli
npm publish --access public
```

## Post-Publishing

After successful publish:

- [ ] Verify on npm: https://www.npmjs.com/package/@envguard/cli
- [ ] Test installation: `npm install -g @envguard/cli`
- [ ] Create Git tag: `git tag v0.1.0 && git push origin v0.1.0`
- [ ] Create GitHub release
- [ ] Update main README if needed
- [ ] Announce on social media (optional)

## Rollback (if needed)

If something went wrong within 24 hours and no one installed it:

```bash
npm unpublish @envguard/cli@<version>
```

**Note**: This is only possible if:

- Less than 24 hours since publish
- No downloads occurred
- Better to deprecate and publish a fix instead
